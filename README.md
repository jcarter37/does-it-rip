Does it Rip?

An app to create, review, and rate snowboards. With this app, users can create new boards based on name, year, price, type, and many other features. In addtion, users can leave reviews and rate boards for others to see in hopes to peak their interest on the board.

Next steps:
I would like to add images to the snowboards so that the users can admire the awesome artwork along with the other attributes of the board.
Fixing the update button styling so it feels more fluid to the page.
Make it more specific when putting in attributes such as $ and decimals.
Add a user login so a user can only edit information that they have entered on the app.
